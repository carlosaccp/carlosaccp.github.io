I gave a short talk at [Brown's Graduate Lecture Series in Analysis and PDEs (GLESPA)](https://glespa-brown.github.io) on the work I conducted when writing my MSc thesis, which is available [here](https://carlosaccp.github.io/files/msc_thesis.pdf).

**Abstract**

We disprove the existence of a locally optimal, stationary and ergodic matching between two Poisson Point Processes in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which extends the literature on matchings between points sampled uniformly at random from a bounded domain to the plane, and connects this highly-geometric problem with (discrete) optimal transport.

The main tool used in this analysis is the so-called Harmonic approximation theorem introduced by Goldman, Huessmann and Otto, which quantitavely analyses the well-known fact that the Monge-Ampere equation near the Lebesgue measure linearises to be the Poisson equation. All work is based on [the following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13590).
