I gave four guest lectures for **APMA1650: Statistical Inference I** at Brown University, on Feb 10th, 12th ,14th and on Apr 14th. In the February lectures, I covered discrete random variables, probability mass functions as well as expectation and variance for this class of random variables. In my upcoming lecture, I will cover more advanced topics such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

Here is a previous version of the course, given by Dr Peyam Tabrizian: [APMA1650](https://sites.brown.edu/drpeyam/apma1650/)
