This is my MSc thesis, where I analysed [Otto, Huesmann and Mattesini's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13590) showing the non-existence of stationary, non-ergodic, quadratic and locally-optimal 2D Poisson matchings. The proof is based on the fact that the  local optimiality of the Poisson matching problem is equivalent to the discrete Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem between the restricted Poisson process counting measures. Analysing this problem and performing a multiscale argument, one arrives at a contradiction, showing that such a matching does not exist. 

There is also a generalisation of this result to $\ell_p$ optimal matchings, where the cost is the $\ell_p$ norm; this is given in a [follow-up paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17687) by the same authors.

I also briefly discuss some open problems and possible extensions of this work, such as extending the result to multi-matchings (where the matching defines a hypergraph) and to multiple point processes in 2D.
