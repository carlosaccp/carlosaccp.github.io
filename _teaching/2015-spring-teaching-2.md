I was UTA for MATH50003 Numerical Analysis at Imperial College London, a 2nd year undergraduate course led by [Dr Sheehan Olver](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~solver/). I attended the weekly problems classes and helped students with their problems, especially with the programming (Julia) part. I also marked the mock exam for said course. More information can be found on the course's [GitHub page](https://github.com/Imperial-MATH50003/MATH50003NumericalAnalysis/tree/main)
