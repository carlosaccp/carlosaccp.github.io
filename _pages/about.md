Hi! I'm Carlos, an MSc in Mathematical Sciences (OMMS) student at the University of Oxford. Prior to coming to Oxford, I completed my undergraduate degree at Imperial College London, also in Mathematics.

I was born in [Coimbra, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbra) to a Portuguese father and a Spanish mother of Catalan origin. I grew up in Madrid, and I am currently living in London. I am a Portuguese and Spanish dual citizen. 

(Due to some differences in Spanish & Portuguese naming conventions, I also use the name Carlos Alberto Perello Mota Pinto.)

Mathematical Interests
======
I am mainly drawn to Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Analysis, and Mathematical Physics. Some topics I have spent some time thinking about include [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)), especially Stochastic Optimal Transport, [Random Matrix Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix), [Interacting Particle Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_system), [Stochastic Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation), [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) and their respective applications to Data Science.

I am planning to learn more about the [KPZ Universality Class](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1596.pdf) and [Integrable Probability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3351.pdf) in the near future. Furthermore, I am counting on taking classes on [Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), [Hydrodynamic Limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_limit) and [Concentration Inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_inequality). Nevertheless, I am always open to new ideas and suggestions! For example, I was recently exposed to [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory) and I am keen to learn more about it.
