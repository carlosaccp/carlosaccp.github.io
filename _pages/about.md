Hi! I'm Carlos, an MSc in Mathematical Sciences (OMMS) student at the University of Oxford. Prior to coming to Oxford, I completed my undergraduate degree at Imperial College London, also in Mathematics. Next year I'll be joining Brown University's Applied Mathematics PhD program.

I was born in [Coimbra, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbra) to a Portuguese father and a Spanish mother of Catalan origin. I grew up in Madrid, and I am currently living in Oxford. I am a Portuguese and Spanish dual citizen. 

(Due to some differences in Spanish & Portuguese naming conventions, I also use the name Carlos Alberto Perello Mota Pinto.)

Mathematical Interests
======
I am mainly drawn to Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Analysis, and Mathematical Physics. Some topics I have spent some time thinking about include [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)), [Random Matrix Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix) and [Interacting Particle Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_system). I also enjoy thinking about discrete probability, and I have a soft spot for Combinatorics and Statistical Mechanics. Finally, I like applying my mathematical knowledge to problems arising from Computer Science and Machine Learning.

I wrote my MSc dissertation on the optimal matching problem and its connection to opttimal transport; I was very lucky to be supervised by [Prof James Martin](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~martin/).

Mentors
======
