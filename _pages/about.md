Heya! I'm Carlos, a 3rd & final year Mathematics student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Next year, I will be pursuing the [MSc in Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematical-sciences) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). After that, I am planning to do a PhD in Mathematics.

I was born in [Coimbra, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbra) to a Portuguese father and a Spanish mother of Catalan origin. I grew up in Madrid, and I am currently living in London. I am a Portuguese and Spanish dual citizen.

Mathematical Interests
======
I have many interests in Mathematics but, roughly speaking, I am mainly drawn to Probability, Analysis, Numerical Analysis and Mathematical Physics. Some topics I have spent some time thinking about include [Random Matrix Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix), [Interacting Particle Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_system), [Stochastic Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation), [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) and their respective applications to Data Science.

I am planning to learn more about the [KPZ Universality Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPZ_universality_class) and [Integrable Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable_probability) in the near future. Furthermore, I am counting on taking classes on [Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), [Hydrodynamic Limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic_limit) and [Concentration Inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_inequality). Nevertheless, I am always open to new ideas and suggestions! For example, I was recently exposed to [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory) and I am keen to learn more about it.
